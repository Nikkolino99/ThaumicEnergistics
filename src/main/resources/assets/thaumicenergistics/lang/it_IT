76 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TERESEARCH.1=As both a scientist and an arcane scholar, you have postulated that it must be possible to combine technology and magic in a stable and productive way.<BR>You will need to study the principals of matter-energy conversion in detail to accomplish this. It is likely there are aspects of Thaumaturgy that can accomplish this, as well as technology capable of doing the same.<BR>This will require extensive study, but you are sure that it will be a worthwhile investment of your time.

81 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TECORES.1=Having discovered how to distill essentia, it occurs to you that you may be able store it digitally.<BR>Examining the §lFormation Core§r and §lAnnihilation Core§r you realize that with some minor modifications they could serve as a means to convert essentia to and from a digital format.<BR>However, due to the corrosive nature of certain types of essentia, a layer of quicksilver around the circuitry is required to prevent decay. 
82 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TECORES.2=§lDiffusion Core§r<BR>The relatively high volatility and immense energy in distilled essentia requires that it first be diffused then digitized. A buffer chamber of some kind will likely be required to hold the diffused essentia.<LINE>§lCoalescence Core§r<BR>Compresses and binds re-materialized essentia diffusion back into its raw form. A buffer chamber will also likely be needed.

93 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEIO.1=Now that you know how to digitize essentia, it's time to put that knowledge to work.<LINE>§lImport & Export§r<BR>By binding the appropriate core to an essentia tube and chamber, you are able to move essentia in and out of the storage network. The use of a filter tube allows you to specify what aspects are allowed to be transferred. 
94 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEIO.2=§lStorage Bus§r<BR>Combining the import and export buses into a single device allows you to use external essentia containers as network storage. Due to the lack of a chamber, it's unlikely to work with anything but warded jars.

109 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEESSPROV.1=While import and export buses are useful for an array of jobs, they lack the flexibility to interface with complex alchemical constructs. To overcome this limitation you have created a device that will allow these constructs to request any essentia directly from the network.<BR>Using the §lEssentia Provider§r should prove to be a simple task. Simply connect it to both the network and construct, and it will do the rest.<BR>Like an essentia buffer it has a small amount of suction(8).

119 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEVISINT.1=Having discovered the vis power network, you now pursue the means of linking your digital system to this network.<BR>After observing how vis flows through the network of §lvis relays§r, you believe you can construct a digital device to harness the vis. By utilizing the peer-to-peer capabilities of the digital network, vis can be imported and used by your digital devices.<BR>Getting the vis out, or even storing it, will require more research. 
120 
 
121 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEVISINT.2=To use the §lVis Relay Interface§r, attach it to the digital network and place a vis relay on it. The base of the relay must be against the interface.<BR>In order for a device to receive vis it must be linked with the interface. Linking other devices to the interface will require the use of a §lMemory Card§r. Each device can only be linked with one interface.<BR>Shift right-click on the interface with a memory card, then right-click on a device to create the link.<BR>Right clicking the device(not the interface) with a blank memory card will remove the link.

127 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEIRONGEARBOX.1=Your experiences with the §lWooden Crank§r has left you to wonder, could this be improved?<BR>You have devised a way of setting up a series of gears in a box so that when any side is turned, all other sides will also turn. However you will need a strong material than wood, to that end you have created the §lIron Gear§r by bonding iron to a wooden gear.<BR>The §lIron Gear Box§r will allow you to crank multiple devices simultaneously. You will need to orient the devices so that their input faces the gearbox. 
128 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEIRONGEARBOX.2=When cranking multiple devices, such as a two grinders & a charger, the crank power will be split evenly between all devices that are currently able to be cranked.<BR>Another advantage of the gearbox is that it can be used by multiple people simultaneously. Each person cranking the gearbox will add to the crank power output.<BR>Now if only you had someone who would stand around all day and crank this for you...

143 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEKNOWLEDGEINSCRIBER.1=With the §lArcane Assembler§r constructed, you will need a way to teach it what it will be assembling.<BR>You have devised the §lKnowledge Core§r, a device capable of storing arcane recipes. The core serves as pattern storage, giving the assembler instructions on how to build items.<BR>To encode recipe patterns on the core, you will need to use the §lKnowledge Inscriber§r. 
144 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEKNOWLEDGEINSCRIBER.2=Using The §lKnowledge Inscriber§r<BR>First place a §lKnowledge Core§r into the top-right slot. Next, use the crafting grid to setup the recipe for the item. If you have the required knowledge(research) for the recipe, the resulting item will be displayed. Pressing the save button will then inscribe the recipe onto the core. The finished product will then show in the stored-pattern area.<BR>To remove an inscribed recipe from the core, first select a pattern from the stored-pattern area. The selected patterns recipe will then display in the crafting area. Finally, clicking the delete button will remove the pattern from the core.

149 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEARCANEASSEMBLER.1=While examining the §lMolecular Assembler§r it occurs to you that it may be possible to modify the assembler to produce arcane items. You conclude that by infusing the assembler with the appropriate shards it will be able to regulate vis flow into items. It will also need a moderate amount of vis storage, and the §lSilverwood Scepter§r seems the best choice.<BR>Note: The scepter is infused into the assembler, and must be fully charged. 
150 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEARCANEASSEMBLER.2=§lPattern Storage§r<BR>The assembler itself does not store crafting recipes. Further research may be required to devise a pattern storage medium.<BR>§lVis Replenishment§r<BR>Replenishing the assembler's internal vis storage will require the services of a §lVis Relay Interface§r.<BR>§lAcceleration Cards§r<BR>Each card decreases crafting time by 20% and increases power required by 50%. 
151 thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEARCANEASSEMBLER.3=§lVis Discounts§r<BR>Due to the inclusion of the crafting scepter, the assembler has a base vis discount equal to that of the scepter. The discount can be further enhanced by providing the assembler vis discount armor. The discount for each aspect can be viewed by hovering over the aspect in the GUI.<BR>The assembler is not immune to the effects of warping gear; For each point of warp the assembler must draw an additional 15% power to remain stable while crafting.
